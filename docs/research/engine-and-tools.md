# Engine and tools: the right ones, the wrong ones, what we lack (Quest WebXR)

Research for the owner's question (10 Oct 2026): are A-Frame 1.7.1, plain modules and our tools the
right ones for a WebXR game on Meta Quest, and what Meta's own tools would add. Meta pages read with
the Meta VR CLI (`metavr docs search` / `metavr docs fetch`, metavr 1.8.0.17.10); GitHub and release
notes on the open web. Marks: **[read]** the page was opened and the quote is in it; **[code]** read
in source code; **[unverified]** not confirmed.

## The parts (each gets an answer or "not found")

1. Meta's WebXR performance guidance, Quest 2 and Quest 3: numbers; draw-call budget per frame or per eye;
   what Meta recommends to cut CPU and draw calls (multiview, instancing, merging, atlases, KTX2, fixed
   foveation, layers, frame rate, baked light).
2. Multiview today: Quest Browser; A-Frame 1.7.x, 1.8.x, newest; three.js (release, OVR_multiview2 vs
   OCULUS_multiview, bugs); IWSDK; Babylon.js; known-good on Quest 2?
   2a. Our own vendor file: does 1.7.1 pass the multiview flag? (vendor/aframe-1.7.1.min.js)
   2b. supermedium/three.js PR #25 (deferred texture uploads lost in 1.8.0).
3. IWSDK: what it is, version, maturity, users; performance, UI, locomotion, store/PWA path, testing
   without a headset (IWER, dev tools); fit for a no-build plain-modules repo; a move from A-Frame
   (what maps to what); cost and risk.
4. Options with cost and gain: (a) A-Frame 1.7.1 + merging/atlases; (b) A-Frame 1.8 / newest;
   (c) patched three.js inside A-Frame; (d) IWSDK; (e) plain three.js; (f) Babylon.js; which one
   Meta's guidance points to for a new Horizon Store WebXR title.
5. Meta tools we do not use: metavr perf / ovrmetrics / traces for the browser; Meta XR Simulator /
   IWER; Horizon Store PWA tooling (bubblewrap); VRC checks; what each would have caught today.

A correction to the brief: the repo does not import `@iwsdk/locomotor`. A grep of `src/`, `index.html`
and `vendor/` finds no `@iwsdk` import; `src/engine/locomotion-math.js` borrows IWSDK's numbers only
("A stick fires past 0.8, the turn threshold of Meta's Immersive Web SDK (packages/core/src/locomotion)").

Parts 3-5 (IWSDK, Babylon.js, the options, Meta's tools) and a side effect of this research are in
[engine-and-tools-2.md](engine-and-tools-2.md); this file holds parts 1-2, the short answer and the recommendation.

## Findings (written as they come)

### Part 1. Meta's WebXR performance guidance (all pages fetched with `metavr docs fetch`, 10 Oct 2026)

- **Budget numbers, Quest 3 vs Quest 2** [read] — "Device-specific optimization (Quest 3 vs Quest 2)", last_updated
  2026-05-11, https://developers.meta.com/horizon/resources/device-optimization-comparison/ — table "Performance targets":
  target frame rate "72 Hz (90 Hz recommended)" (Quest 3) / "72 Hz" (Quest 2); frame budget "13.8 ms (at 72 Hz)" both;
  "**Recommended draw calls** | < 200 | < 100"; "**Recommended triangles per frame** | < 1.5M | < 750K"; GPU "~2.5x Quest 2 GPU";
  "Quest 2 is more draw-call sensitive. Batch geometry and use instanced rendering where possible."
- **Per frame or per eye?** The page does not say. The triangles row says "per frame"; the draw-calls row has no unit.
  The page is engine-generic (its "see" links go to Unity, Unreal and Native performance pages, not to Web), and on those
  engines Quest builds render both eyes in one pass by default [unverified for this page; the native page
  `documentation/native/po-perf-opt-mobile` returned 45 bytes through metavr]. So reading "< 100" as "per frame with
  both eyes drawn by one call each" is the strict reading our tests already use (50 per view then; now `QUEST2_FRAME` = 100 a frame, both eyes counted in VR); reading it
  as one submission per object per frame (multiview) is the native reading. **Unverified which one Meta means.**
- **Draw calls cost CPU, not GPU** [read] — "WebXR performance optimization workflow", 2026-07-21,
  https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/web/webxr-perf-workflow/ — "draw calls can be CPU intensive";
  "Submitting 1000 individual triangles as unique draw calls would likely cause your app to run at less than 72 frames
  per second". Fixes named there, in this order: "merge small meshes into larger chunks"; "Both multi-view rendering and
  instanced mesh rendering are great options for reducing the number of draw calls"; "minimizing state changes between
  draw calls"; batching "objects that use the same material into a single call"; portal/occlusion culling; LOD;
  "Any app logic that takes longer than two milliseconds should be considered for optimization." Frame budgets listed:
  "72 FPS = 13.7 milliseconds per frame", "90 FPS = 11.1 milliseconds per frame". First step it demands: find out CPU- or
  GPU-bound ("not render anything"), then vertex- or fragment-bound (render scale 0.01).
- **Multiview** [read] — "Multiview WebGL Rendering" (undated), https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/web/web-multiview/ —
  "Multiview is an experimental feature"; "Only CPU-bound experiences will benefit from multi-view. Often, a CPU usage
  reduction of 25% - 50% is possible"; "`OCULUS_multiview` is available out-of-the-box in the Browser, while the
  `OVR_multiview2` extension is behind the flag"; "Only WebGL 2.0 supports this extension"; it is set up through a WebXR
  Layers projection layer with `textureType: "texture-array"`; "This is the recommended way to render a scene on Quest hardware."
- **Textures** [read] — "WebXR Performance Best Practices" (undated), https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/web/webxr-perf-bp/ —
  "KTX 2.0/Basis Universal is the recommended approach to texture-compression for WebXR experiences on Meta Quest devices".
  Device page: "Compress textures using ASTC format".
- **Lights, baked light** [read] — same page: "limit yourself to one directional light or one point light if you're making
  heavy use of PBR materials"; "For fully static setups (i.e., static lighting and static objects), consider baking
  lighting into lightmaps." Shadows: "Drawing the scene to render the shadow map counts against your overall scene budget
  for draw calls and triangles."
- **Clear colour** [read] — same page: "Set your clear color to white or black" (Adreno "Fast clear" on Quest 1 and 2).
  Our room 01 clears to `#0b0b0d` (src/rooms/01-control/scene.js:25), not black: a small free fix to measure.
- **Staggered updates** [read] — same page: "you might only need to update animations 30 times a second even though
  you're rendering at 90 frames a second".
- **Fixed foveation** [read] — workflow page: FFR "can significantly improve performance"; it is for fragment-bound apps.
  We set `foveationLevel: 0` for sharp door numbers (scene.js:17-20): right while we are CPU-bound, worth re-testing
  at "low" if a GPU (fragment) bound is found.
- **Frame rate** [read] — "WebXR App Framerate Control" (undated), https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/web/webxr-frames/ —
  "A WebXR session on the Browser runs by default at 90 frames per second on Meta Quest 2 and 72 frames per second on Meta
  Quest headsets"; set with `session.updateTargetFrameRate` (Browser 16.4+). Our code never calls it (grep of src/: no
  `updateTargetFrameRate`), so **on Quest 2 our budget may be 11.1 ms, not 13.7 ms** [unverified on a Quest 2 today; the page is old].
- **Layers** [read] — "WebXR Layers", https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/web/webxr-layers/ — "With Layers, you
  only need to submit rendered content when the layer updates"; workflow page: "rendering the background scene of your
  application into a layer means you only need to re-render it when the background changes". Also "Higher quality
  rendering of imagery and text" (fits the clipboard and the plaques).
- **Measuring tools Meta names for the browser** [read] — "WebXR Performance Tools", https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/web/webxr-perf-tools/ —
  OVR Metrics Tool HUD ("highly recommended that you keep this HUD up and running throughout development");
  `ovrgpuprofiler --realtime="29,30"` (vertex vs fragment share); CPU cost through `chrome://inspect#devices` → "trace"
  with the "xr.debug" category; RenderDoc Meta fork (draw-call GPU cost).

### Part 2a. Our A-Frame 1.7.1: multiview cannot turn on [code, verified 10 Oct]

- `vendor/aframe-1.7.1.min.js` (A-Frame "1.7.1", three.js REVISION "173") defines the XR manager as
  `class Rm extends gr{constructor(t,e,n,i){...` and switches multiview with `r.isMultiview=i&&n.has("OCULUS_multiview")`
  (fourth argument). The renderer builds it as `const wt=new Rm(E,xt);` — two arguments — so `isMultiview` is always
  false. The renderer does read the option (`multiviewStereo:d=!1`, and A-Frame passes `n.multiviewStereo`), it is
  simply never handed to the manager. The caller's statement is confirmed.
- In the same file `runDeferredUploads` appears once (its definition) and is never called; harmless there because
  deferral is only switched on in the multiview path.

### Part 2b. A-Frame 1.8.0 and master: multiview is passed, the deferred texture uploads are lost [code + read]

- A-Frame 1.8.0, released 2026-06-24 (GitHub API `releases/tags/v1.8.0`), is the newest release (npm `latest` = 1.8.0).
  Its package.json: `"three": "npm:super-three@0.184.0"`; release notes: "Update THREE to r184". A-Frame master
  (commit 4573b95, 2026-07-08, "Bump THREE to r185") uses `npm:super-three@0.185.0`.
- super-three's renderer (jsdelivr `super-three@<v>/build/three.module.js`, grep):
  - 0.181.0: `new WebXRManager( _this, _gl, extensions, multiviewStereo )` and, after the scene, `textures.runDeferredUploads();` (line 17226) — **fixed**.
  - 0.184.0 (A-Frame 1.8.0): `if ( xr.enabled && xr.isMultiview ) { textures.setDeferTextureUploads( true ); ...`
    (line 18105) but **no call** to `runDeferredUploads` anywhere — **broken**.
  - 0.185.0 (A-Frame master, super-three `latest`, 2026-07-08): same as 0.184.0 — **broken**.
  So with `multiviewStereo: true` on 1.8.0 or master, a texture first uploaded during a multiview frame is queued and
  never uploaded (stays black). The reviewer's statement is confirmed for 1.8.0 and also holds for master.
- The history [read] — https://github.com/supermedium/three.js/pull/25 "Fix multiview for WebXRManager, restoring and
  updating lost changes", merged 2025-09-17; its first point: the `textures.runDeferredUploads()` call had been lost.
  A comment of 2026-03-24 (KooIaIa) says the fix "was overwritten in dev again"; vincentfretin (2026-03-28): correct in
  branch `super-r181` (commit 9bee41b), the dev commit broken. https://github.com/supermedium/three.js/pull/26 "Added
  WebXR Spacewarp on top of Multiview" (open since 2026-03-24, no review) "Re-adds multiview fixes that were lost in an
  upstream update"; its A-Frame side is aframevr/aframe#5795 (open).
- A-Frame's own documentation of the flag [read] — https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aframevr/aframe/v1.8.0/docs/components/renderer.md —
  "Performance improvement for applications that are CPU limited and draw count bound"; uploads are "deferred until the
  rendering of the main scene has ended, adding one extra frame of latency"; "Another issue is rendering mirror
  reflexions or rendering another view in the middle of the scene. The logic would have to move to the beginning of the
  frame"; "this flag is disabled by default". This matters to us: src/engine/mirror.js and reflect-env.js render other
  views. A user report on Quest 2 (aframevr/aframe#5260, 2024-01-31): text vanished in immersive mode with
  `multiviewStereo: true`; mrxz: "With multiview you're not allowed to perform any texture operations once rendering has started."

### Part 2c. three.js upstream, IWSDK, Meta's skill text [code]

- **Upstream three.js** (npm `three` latest = 0.186.1, jsdelivr build, grep): `build/three.module.js` (WebGLRenderer)
  has **no** "multiview" at all. `build/three.webgpu.js` (WebGPURenderer, also on its WebGL 2 fallback) has XR
  multiview: `constructor( renderer, multiview = false )`, and it turns on only
  `if ( this._useMultiviewIfPossible && renderer.hasFeature( 'OVR_multiview2' ) )`. Meta's multiview page says
  `OVR_multiview2` "is behind the flag (chrome://flags)" in the Quest Browser while `OCULUS_multiview` is on by default,
  so upstream three.js multiview may not engage on Quest Browser at all [unverified on today's browser; Meta's page is undated].
  Multiview with WebGLRenderer exists only in the supermedium fork ("super-three"), which A-Frame and IWSDK both use.
- **IWSDK turns multiview on by default, on the good fork build** [code] — `@iwsdk/core@1.0.1` (npm latest, 2026-10-01)
  depends on `"three": "npm:super-three@0.181.0"` — the build that still calls `textures.runDeferredUploads()` — and
  `dist/init/world-initializer.js` creates `new WebGLRenderer({ antialias: true, ... multiviewStereo: true, ... })`;
  `dist/init/xr.js` offers `['local-floor', 'bounded-floor', 'layers']` by default (multiview needs the layers feature).
  So the one shipped stack that runs supermedium multiview with its upload fix in place today is IWSDK.
- **Meta's IWSDK agent skill** (meta-vr plugin, `skills/hz-iwsdk-webxr/SKILL.md`) [read]: "Draw call budget is much lower
  than native -- Aim for under 50-80 draw calls on Quest 2 and under 100-120 on Quest 3. JavaScript overhead per draw
  call is higher than native." `references/performance-tips.md`: "Aim for fewer than 100 draw calls total"; "Multiview
  effectively halves the draw call count for stereo rendering. It is supported on all Quest headsets and should be
  enabled whenever possible." **Caution**: the same reference shows APIs that do not match the sources I read —
  `renderer.xr.useMultiview = true` (no such property in super-three or three.js; multiview is a renderer constructor
  option), `session.fixedFoveatedRendering.level` (Meta's FFR page uses `XRWebGLLayer.fixedFoveation`),
  `navigator.xr.enableSpaceWarp` [unverified], "Triangle count under 750K per eye" (Meta's device page: "per frame"),
  and "Quest Browser defaults to 72 Hz" (Meta's frame-rate page: 90 on Quest 2). The skill is a helper, not a source.

### Part 2b (cont.). The A-Frame 1.8.0 build itself [code]

- `aframe@1.8.0/dist/aframe-v1.8.0.js` (jsdelivr, grep): `const xr=new WebXRManager(_this,_gl,extensions,multiviewStereo);`
  (line 53318) — multiview is passed; occurrences: `setDeferTextureUploads(true)` 1, `runDeferredUploads(){` 1 (the
  definition), `textures.runDeferredUploads()` **0**. Every texture first uploaded during an XR frame with multiview on
  is queued forever. In our game that is every canvas we redraw in VR: panel.js, the clipboard sheet and ink.js (hand
  writing), board.js, lightbox.js, decal.js, blob-shadow.js (grep `CanvasTexture|needsUpdate = true` in src/).
- Our mirrors already render in `tick`, before either eye (src/engine/reflect-env.js:5-6, mirror.js:2-3: "captured once"),
  which is what A-Frame's docs ask for under multiview.

### Part 1 (cont.). A second Meta budget: native ranges per frame [read]

- Meta, "Unity performance" (last_updated 2024-10-30), https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/unity/unity-perf/ —
  "Various factors influence the number of draw calls you can execute per frame"; table: "Quest 2, Quest Pro | 80-200 |
  Busy Simulation", "200-300 | Medium", "400-600 | Light Simulation"; Quest 3/3S 200-300 / 400-600 / 700-1000. "Light
  Simulation: Applications with minimal pipeline state changes such as escape room games, puzzle games". These are Unity
  numbers (Unity on Quest renders single-pass multiview; Meta's draw-call analysis page notes "there are twice as many
  objects" in VR, https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/unity/po-draw-call-analysis/). Meta's WebXR pages
  give no draw-call number of their own; the "< 100 on Quest 2" is the device-comparison page, engine-generic.
  Our strict reading (< 100 per frame, both eyes drawn separately → < 50 per view) is the safe one; Meta does not say
  "per eye" anywhere I read.

### Part 2a (cont.). 1.7.1 has both faults [code]

- The same vendored file also holds the multiview render path:
  `if(X&&At.render(t),wt.enabled&&wt.isMultiview)et.setDeferTextureUploads(!0),Ot(m,t,e,e.cameras[0].viewport);`
  and no call of `runDeferredUploads`. So 1.7.1 would need two edits to run multiview: hand the flag and the extensions
  to the manager, and run the deferred uploads after the scene. The supermedium PR history matches: #22 "Fix multiview"
  (closed unmerged, 2025-01-31), #24 "some changes were lost in a previous rebase" (closed, 2025-08-14), #25 merged
  2025-09-17 (GitHub API `repos/supermedium/three.js/pulls?state=all`).

### Part 2 summary: multiview, where it works today

| Stack | Multiview passed | Deferred uploads run | State |
|---|---|---|---|
| A-Frame 1.7.1 (ours; super-three r173) | no (`new Rm(E,xt)`) | no | off; two edits to turn on [code] |
| A-Frame 1.8.0 (2026-06-24; super-three 0.184.0) | yes | **no** | on = textures drawn first in VR stay black [code] |
| A-Frame master (2026-07-13; super-three 0.185.0) | yes | **no** | same as 1.8.0 [code] |
| super-three 0.181.0 | yes | yes | the good build [code] |
| IWSDK 1.0.1 (super-three 0.181.0) | yes, on by default | yes | the only shipped stack with it on [code]; Quest 2 not confirmed |
| three.js upstream 0.186.1 WebGLRenderer | no multiview | — | [code] |
| three.js upstream WebGPURenderer | only via `OVR_multiview2` | — | Meta: that extension is behind a flag in Quest Browser [read, undated page] |
| Babylon.js | via the Layers feature | — | library materials lack multiview shaders (Apr 2025) [read, forum] |

Does `OCULUS_multiview` exist in today's Quest Browser? Meta's page says yes ("available out-of-the-box"), undated;
no 2026 report either way was found; IWSDK 1.0 relies on it. **Unverified on our headset**: one line in the headset
console (`renderer.getContext().getExtension('OCULUS_multiview')`) settles it.

## Answer to the owner's question, in short

- **Right tools**: A-Frame/three.js is a stack Meta documents for the Store (pwa-webxr gives A-Frame code); merging
  by material (merge-static.js) is Meta's first-listed fix; measuring draw calls on every push is sound.
- **Right tools used the wrong way**: the renderer's `multiviewStereo` cannot work in our 1.7.1 (and is unsafe in
  1.8.0/master); the clear colour is not black; the frame rate is never set; FFR is off (right only while we are not
  fragment-bound — never measured).
- **Missing**: Meta's first step, CPU- or GPU-bound (Chrome `xr.debug` trace, OVR Metrics HUD, `metavr perf`);
  RenderDoc for one frame; IWER for a VR run in CI; a Quest 2 to measure on (all numbers so far are from a Quest 3).

## Unverified (said plainly)

- Whether Meta's "< 100 draw calls" on Quest 2 means per eye or per frame: the page does not say.
- `OCULUS_multiview` in today's Quest Browser on our headset; multiview known-good on a Quest 2 in any stack.
- Quest 2's default WebXR rate today (Meta page: 90; Meta's IWSDK skill: 72).
- `metavr perf capture --app com.oculus.browser` on a WebXR page; IWSDK without Vite; VRC-local on a TWA APK;
  whether SpatialSim runs Quest Browser; Meta's web in-app purchase page (metavr returned nothing).

## Recommendation and first step

Stay on A-Frame now and do (a) — it is needed on every engine — plus the free fixes; keep (c), a 1.8.0 with the one
lost line, as the next candidate, decided by measurement; do not move to IWSDK now (build step, 16 days at 1.0, no
Quest 2 evidence), revisit if A-Frame's multiview stays broken. First concrete step: one headset session, owner's word
first: in the game page console read `renderer.getContext().getExtension('OCULUS_multiview')`,
`xrSession.frameRate` and `supportedFrameRates`, then record a Chrome `xr.debug` trace of the corridor's worst view to
learn CPU- or GPU-bound. That one measurement decides whether multiview (c) or fragment work (FFR, textures) comes first.

## The wider revision of every tool (10.10)
One file per area, written as found: `revision-1-store.md` (delivery and the Horizon Store), `revision-2-data.md` (data, server, law), `revision-3-live-voice-mr.md` (live players, voice, mixed reality), `revision-4-graphics.md` (graphics and content), `revision-5-testing-process.md` (testing and our tools).
