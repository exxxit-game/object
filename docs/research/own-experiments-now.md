# Running our own experiments now: what the field does, what fits us, how to do it properly

Research for the owner's idea of new experiments with real players, in the present (docs/ideas/owner-experiments.md).
Every claim has its link and a short quote from the page read. "Unverified" marks what was not confirmed on a
primary page. Parts 4 (running and publishing), 5 (data-quality risks) and the list of what is still open are in
[own-experiments-now-2.md](own-experiments-now-2.md). How working labs run studies outside the lab, lab by lab:
[field-labs-1.md](field-labs-1.md), [field-labs-2.md](field-labs-2.md); ethics review and data law for a team without a
university: [ethics-law.md](ethics-law.md); how a lab runs a study, step by step, applied to a room:
[study-methods.md](study-methods.md); how science projects reached millions, and fun without spoiling data: [science-reach.md](science-reach.md). Parts, each answered or marked "not found":

The owner's questions about rooms (his words, our translation) and where each is answered; a question stays here
until its answer is read and sourced:
- "How did they collect data, what did they count as valid, what did they screen out?": field-labs-1/2, study-methods-1 part 2.
- "At home you play for fun, you don't try like in a lab": study-methods-1 part 1 (commitment, playable practice,
  end-of-run seriousness and no-blame questions, self-knowledge as the reward).
- "Start with a minute of fun, then: let's take this seriously": study-methods-1 1g (practice trial, then commitment).
- "Without humour you are a lab rat; a host leads you through the story": owner's decision (docs/owner-decisions.md);
  fun around the measured moment, plain inside it (Lumsden 2016); science-reach.md part 3 (Sea Hero Quest, Portal).
- "How did those projects get millions of users?": science-reach.md parts 1-2.
- "Take all they solved, check how far it solves the problem; how precise can our data be, how do they measure
  precision?": precision study (running).
- "Who approves our ethics?": ethics-law.md 1; open: MGPPU and SPbU committees (owner's pages, [own-experiments-now-2.md](own-experiments-now-2.md)).
- "Which labs work now, and in Russia?": field-labs-1/2; open: MSU and MSUPE VR labs (owner's pages).
- Two phones: part 3 here; open: Shiv 2005, Wilson & Nisbett 1978 (owner's pages).

1. What psychology runs now (2023-2026) that a home VR game could join or run: 1a multi-site studies and registered
   reports; 1b citizen science and game-based research; 1c VR studies outside the lab; 1d open questions.
2. 8-12 candidate experiments for our setup (one player, 5-10 min, body and head data, Russian-speaking first).
3. The two-phones idea: 3a confabulation (Nisbett & Wilson 1977); 3b choice blindness; 3c price as a quality cue;
   3d what our version adds.
4. Running and publishing: 4a ethics review without a university; 4b preregistration; 4c data rules; 4d partners.
5. Risks to data quality (inattention, repeat players, bots, suspicion) and how studies handle them.

## Findings

### 1b. Game-based citizen science: Sea Hero Quest

- Spiers, Coutrot & Hornberger (2023), Topics in Cognitive Science 15(1), 120-138, "Explaining world-wide variation
  in navigation ability from millions of people: Citizen science project Sea Hero Quest".
  https://ueaeprints.uea.ac.uk/id/eprint/86715 — the game was used to "test 3.9 million people on their navigation
  ability", players "from 18 to 99 years of age", analysis over "all countries sufficiently sampled (N = 63)";
  "All countries showed a male advantage"; city upbringing linked to worse navigation.
- Origin (CNRS News, read): Koppe, "A Video Game for Detecting Alzheimer's Disease", 27 May 2019,
  https://news.cnrs.fr/print/1460 — "The initiative came in 2015 from the company Deutsche Telekom, which contacted
  University College London"; "called on a professional developer, Glitchers"; "released in May 2016"; data sent
  "with the participant's consent"; "four million players". CORRECTED: the page gives no cost or time figure; the
  "$10 billion" was found nowhere. A CNRS press release (https://www.cnrs.fr/en/press/video-game-aids-research-alzheimers-disease)
  is listed in search as equating the data to "10,000 years" of lab data (search listing only: unverified).
- Lesson for us: a game made by a studio with a university partner, data with consent, published in top venues.

### 1c. VR studies run outside the lab, on players' own headsets

- Mottelson, Petersen, Lilija & Makransky (2021), Frontiers in Virtual Reality 2:681482, "Conducting Unsupervised
  Virtual Reality User Studies Online". https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/virtual-reality/articles/10.3389/frvir.2021.681482/full
  - Own Oculus Quest headsets, recruited mainly on Reddit, $15 gift card. Study I: 161 online vs 185 in lab,
    collected over 11 days; about 13% online showed no or negative learning gain vs 3% in the lab.
  - Hand tracking: a screening test cut rejected hand data from 27% (8 of 30, pilot) to 8% (3 of 39).
  - Quotes: "a good reliability of collected data, which requires only slightly more sanitation than a comparable
    laboratory study"; "We estimate an approximate 10% ill-intended user participation which can be mitigated with
    appropriate practices"; "over-recruitment is necessary because of the number of aberrant responses".
- Cesanek, Shivkumar, Ingram & Wolpert (2024), Nature Human Behaviour 8(6):1209-1224, "Ouvrai opening access to
  remote VR studies of human behavioral neuroscience". https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11199109/
  - Open-source, runs in the headset's web browser through the WebXR Device API with Three.js (same family of
    technology as our A-Frame game); Firebase hosting; recruits on Prolific with a "VR headset ownership" screener.
  - 30 participants from 14 countries; paid $5-6; about 10 participants per experiment within 90 minutes of
    posting; median about 18 minutes; latency 8.3 ms on a Meta Quest 2.
  - Claim: "immersion, interactivity, and data quality rivaling what is currently achievable in a physical
    laboratory" (their comparison to lab results was qualitative, no direct lab dataset).
- Lesson for us: a browser WebXR study on home Quests is published in Nature Human Behaviour; our tech stack is
  already the kind the field uses. Paid recruitment (Prolific) is the norm for these small studies; our free
  floor could give far larger and more natural samples, but self-selected.

### 1b (cont.). Unpaid volunteers who play for feedback about themselves: LabintheWild

- LabintheWild home page lists 19 current online tests (self-image, Eastern vs Western perception, peripheral
  vision, multitasking, decision-making style, reading emotions from eyes, comparing your values with a chatbot's,
  and more); the reward is a comparison of yourself with others: "Find out how the image you have of yourself
  compares to other people across the globe". https://www.labinthewild.org/
- Who runs it (read): University of Washington, https://wildlab.cs.washington.edu/Project_LabintheWild.html —
  built "in 2012 (together with Krzysztof Gajos at Harvard)" by Katharina Reinecke's lab; "visited by more than 5
  million volunteer participants" from "more than 200 countries"; "more than 50 peer-reviewed publications".
- Huber & Gajos (2020), PLoS One 15(1):e0227629, "Conducting online virtual environment experiments with
  uncompensated, unsupervised samples" (Harvard), run on LabintheWild. https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6992162/
  - Study 1 (maze navigation): 311 completers; "Our results replicate findings previously obtained in conventional
    laboratory settings".
  - Study 2 (Proteus effect: taller avatar, negotiation): 1,334 volunteers in two months; taller avatars made more
    self-favouring splits, but the effect was smaller than the original (Cohen's d 0.34 vs 1.23) and the
    acceptance effect did not replicate.
  - Pay was replaced by feedback about yourself (navigation style; negotiation skill). Only 27 of 1,645 used a
    headset: home VR was still rare then.
- Lesson for us: the "MythBusters, you are the subject" reveal is the same reward LabintheWild uses instead of money.

### 1a. Large multi-site studies and registered reports

- Psychological Science Accelerator: "a globally distributed network of researchers that pool intellectual and
  material resources to accelerate the accumulation of rigorous knowledge in psychological science"; proposals by
  open call. https://psysciacc.org/ — About (read, https://psysciacc.org/about.html): "The PSA began in August
  2017"; "100 labs signed up for the consortium one month after the post went live". No current lab or country
  count on either page (the home page's member dashboard loads by script: not read).
- PSA projects (read, https://psysciacc.org/projects.html): 15 projects, PSA001-009, PSA-CR 001-003, PSA-JTF1-3;
  e.g. PSA001 Face Perception "11 world regions, 41 countries and 11,570 participants"; PSA006 Trolley Problem
  "in 45 countries"; PSA-CR 003 "n = 25,718 from 89 countries". No VR study on the page.
- Many Labs 2 (APS Observer, 28 Dec 2018): 28 classic and contemporary findings, "more than 60 labs across 36
  nations and territories", 14 of 28 replicated; population characteristics had "little to no bearing on the
  failure of a finding to replicate".
  https://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/replications-dont-hinge-on-sample-and-setting-differences-multilab-project-shows
- Kurt Lewin Institute Many Labs grant (read, April 2025 PDF,
  https://kurtlewininstituut.nl/wp-content/uploads/sites/426/2025/04/KLI-Many-Labs-grant-information.pdf): "The
  maximum amount of the grant is 9.000 euros"; it invites "all KLI members" (a Dutch graduate school) and expects at
  least two university/lab groups; deadline May 15, 2025. Confirmed: members only, not open to us.
- What it means for us: the field's current answer to the replication crisis is many sites, big samples and plans
  fixed in advance. A game with thousands of players is "one site, very many people"; joining the PSA as a member
  lab, or offering a VR version of a PSA study, is the route in (no PSA VR study exists on its projects page).

## 3. The owner's two-phones idea: closest published work

### 3a. Reasons given for a choice not made for those reasons (Nisbett & Wilson 1977)

- Nisbett, R. E. & Wilson, T. D. (1977). Telling more than we can know: Verbal reports on mental processes.
  Psychological Review 84, 231-259. Record: https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/92167?show=full
  READ pp. 243-244 from the page images of the scan (its text layer is garbled):
  https://web.math.princeton.edu/~sswang/literature_general_unsorted/Nisbett-Wilson-PsychologicalReview1977.pdf
  (excerpt saved: objekt-papers/nisbett-1977.txt). Two studies in shops, "under the guise of a consumer survey":
  "four different nightgowns in one study (378 subjects) and four identical pairs of nylon stockings in the other
  (52 subjects)"; asked which was "the best quality"; "the right-most stockings being preferred over the left-most
  by a factor of almost four to one"; "no subject ever mentioned spontaneously the position"; asked directly,
  "virtually all subjects denied it". Their guess: the shopper's habit of "shopping around".
- CORRECTED: the paper names no reasons; "knit" or "sheerness" are not in it. Newell & Shanks say "more details
  of the original experiments are given in Wilson & Nisbett 1978" (Social Psychology 41:118-131,
  https://hdl.handle.net/2027.42/92172, "Access restricted to U-M campus"): per-position shares and the reasons
  shoppers gave stay unverified until that paper is read (owner).
- Its reach (read, objekt-papers/johansson-2006.txt): Johansson, Hall, Sikström, Tärning & Lind (2006),
  Consciousness and Cognition 15:673-692, https://www.lucs.lu.se/fileadmin/user_upload/lucs/2011/01/Johansson-et-al.-2006-How-Something-Can-Be-Said-About-Telling-More-Than-We-Can-Know.pdf
  — "perhaps the most cited article in the recent history of consciousness studies, yet no empirical research
  program currently exists" that continues it. Their own data: 80 participants, 15 face pairs, 4 s each, 480
  reasons; reasons for swapped and real choices showed "very few differences".
- Critique (read, objekt-papers/newell-2014.txt): Newell & Shanks (2014), Behavioral and Brain Sciences
  37(1):1-19, preprint https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1419217/ — asking about position "fails the relevance
  criterion"; a rule "if the current item is no worse in terms of quality than the previous item, then prefer the
  current item" yields the right-most pick without position causing it. CORRECTED: the umn.edu PDF cited before is
  a page of BBS commentaries on their article, not the review itself.

### 3b. Choice blindness (Johansson, Hall and colleagues; read from objekt-papers)

- Johansson, Hall, Sikström & Olsson (2005), Science 310:116-119 (text: objekt-papers/johansson-2005.txt; card
  docs/cards/johansson-2005.md). 120 participants, faces swapped by a card trick: "With a total of 354
  manipulated trials performed, only 46 (13%) were detected concurrently"; reasons for the swapped face did not
  differ from reasons for real choices; 13.3% of them named features only the swapped face had.
- Hall, Johansson & Strandberg (2012), "Lifting the Veil of Morality: Choice Blindness and Attitude Reversals on a
  Self-Transforming Survey", PLoS ONE (text: objekt-papers/hall-2012.txt). 160 volunteers; "a full 69% of the
  participants failed to detect at least one of two changes"; people "often constructed coherent and unequivocal
  arguments supporting the opposite of their original position".
- Hall, Johansson, Tärning, Sikström & Deutgen (2010), "Magic at the marketplace", Cognition 117(1):54-61 (READ,
  objekt-papers/hall-2010.txt; https://www.lucs.lu.se/fileadmin/user_upload/lucs/2011/01/Hall-et-al.-2010-Magic-at-the-Marketplace-Choice-Blindness-for-the-Taste-of-Jam-and-the-Smell-of-Tea.pdf):
  "180 consumers (118 female) at a supermarket in Lund, Sweden", ages 16-80, posing as quality surveyors; 3 jam and
  3 tea pairs, "30 M and 30 NM trials" per pair; a two-sided jar turned over secretly. "In total, 33.3% of the
  manipulated jam trials, and 32.2% of the manipulated tea trials were detected" (concurrently 14.4% and 13.8%).
  Half were promised the chosen item as a gift: tea detection was 19.6% with the gift vs 46.3% without.
- Recent work. Read on PubMed (titles only, https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22choice+blindness%22&sort=date):
  "Choice Blindness in a Military Setting" (Patterson, Hum Factors, Sep 2026, PMID 42041049); pupillometry
  "evidence of covert detection" (Grassi, Front Psychol, Dec 2025, PMID 41426389); "Social cues for experimenter
  incompetence influence choice blindness" (Marchant, Conscious Cogn, Jul 2025, PMID 40381527).
  From search listings only (unverified): autistic vs non-autistic adults, Remington et al., J. Cognitive
  Psychology 2024, doi:10.1080/20445911.2024.2356283, 16 vs 21 adults, equal rates (open PDF at
  https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/10192819/, not read); a preregistered no-deception arm with a one-week retest is
  likely Olson et al. (BIAL grant 347/20 reports, 145 and 147 students, https://www.fundacaobial.com/media/4353/2020-open-label-choice-blindness.pdf);
  religious attitudes (2025, https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/2153599X.2025.2557482, not read).
  CORRECTED: no 2024 pension study was found; the pension study found is McLaughlin & Somerville (2013), Judgment
  and Decision Making 8(5):577-588 (listing: 100 people, at most 37.2% detected). The "online study of 498" was not
  found (an online paper with 955 people, Strandberg et al. 2020, was listed instead): not found.
- VR versions (both read). Lingonblad et al., "Virtual Blindness", IVA 2015, LNCS 9238:442-451 (Lund record
  https://lup.lub.lu.se/search/publication/282f44a7-04a9-4755-b818-2388a93809cd; Springer's page needs a login):
  38 participants, a virtual experimenter, 16 portrait pairs, 4 swapped; more and earlier detections in the
  low-immersion condition; head-mounted displays named only as future work (CORRECTED: not a headset study).
  Arora, Gupta & Parnami, UIST 2019 Adjunct, pp. 84-86 (poster, free, https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3332167.3357123):
  racial-bias choices; "92% of subjects failed to notice a mismatch in their choices, while 75% exhibited choice
  blindness"; N not given in the abstract.

### 3c. Price as a cue to quality: marketing placebo (read)

- Plassmann, O'Doherty, Shiv & Rangel (2008), "Marketing actions can modulate neural representations of
  experienced pleasantness", PNAS 105(3):1050-1054. https://rnl.caltech.edu/publications/pdf/plassmann2008.pdf
  - 20 subjects; three wines shown as five: wine 1 at "$5 real retail price, $45 fictitious price", wine 2 at
    "$90 real retail price, $10 fictitious price", a $35 distracter.
  - "increasing the price of a wine increases subjective reports of flavor pleasantness as well as
    blood-oxygen-level-dependent activity in medial orbitofrontal cortex"; pleasantness correlated with price
    (r = 0.59); no effect on taste intensity.
  - Blind retasting 8 weeks later without prices: "there were no reported differences among the wines".
  - The authors' own caveat: "some subjects might deem it inappropriate to report to the experimenter that a
    cheaper wine tastes better" (experimenter demand). Subjects "were not debriefed" (Caltech's small pool): we
    would debrief everyone.
- Shiv, Carmon & Ariely (2005), "Placebo effects of marketing actions: Consumers may get what they pay for",
  Journal of Marketing Research 42(4):383-393, DOI 10.1509/jmkr.2005.42.4.383. Abstract (Duke record, read,
  https://scholars.duke.edu/publication/861346): "marketing actions, such as pricing, can alter the actual efficacy
  of products"; people who paid a discounted price for an energy drink solved fewer puzzles. No open full text
  (SAGE paywall; Duke lists no PDF): the drink, prices ($1.89 vs $0.89 in retellings) and puzzle counts stay
  UNVERIFIED (owner).

### 3d. What our version would test that is new (our design reasoning, not a published finding)

- Known: people give confident reasons for choices driven by things they do not report (3a, 3b); a price label
  changes reported quality of the same thing (3c).
- Not covered by the work read here: (1) a price on an object that is worthless to everyone, since a VR phone
  cannot be owned or used; taking the "$10,000" phone costs nothing, so it isolates the price cue from any real
  gain; (2) whether the reasons name the price or invent features ("calls better"), coded from the player's own
  words, which is Nisbett & Wilson's question asked of thousands; (3) a Plassmann-style quality test inside VR:
  both phones play the SAME call audio and the player rates the sound; does the "$10,000" phone sound better?
  (4) left/right position counterbalanced, so the position effect is measured on the side; head data give the
  order the phones were looked at, the very thing Newell & Shanks say position stands in for (ours).
- Hall et al. 2010 found fewer detections when the chosen item was a gift (19.6% vs 46.3%): a free "take it" may
  matter (ours, from 3b).
- Sketch: two identical phones, labels $10,000 / $10 (sides random) → "take one" (grab with hand) → "why?"
  (voice optional, else pick from reasons incl. "the price") → "call someone" on each, same audio, rate sound →
  reveal: same phone, same sound, your reason, and the share of players who said the same.
- Before design (rule 16): Nisbett & Wilson 1977 (pp. 243-244) and Hall et al. 2010 are now in objekt-papers;
  still missing: Wilson & Nisbett 1978 (stocking details) and Shiv et al. 2005 (both behind logins: owner).

## 1d. Open questions the field says need data (from the pages read; no published "agenda list" was found)

- Robustness: Many Labs 2 replicated 14 of 28 (link in 1a). A VR doorway study "call[s] into question the
  generalisability and robustness of this effect" (McFadyen et al. 2021, below). Online VR effects come out
  smaller (Huber & Gajos 2020: d 0.34 vs 1.23).
- Who is sampled: home Quest owners were 86% male, median age 26; "claims about generalizability should be avoided"
  (Mottelson et al. 2021, verified in docs/research/vr/06-science.md). Cultures: the PSA runs moral-dilemma
  judgments across countries (PSA006, 45 countries). Russian-speaking VR players are a sample none of the papers
  read had.

## 2. Candidate experiments for our setup (one player, 5-10 min, hands and head tracked, voice optional)

Format: builds on / still unknown / what VR at scale adds / sketch. "Unknown" is from the paper where quoted,
otherwise our reading (marked). Fit rules from 06-science.md: no high-stress or startle content unsupervised at
home (Steed et al. 2016, doi:10.1109/TVCG.2016.2518135); compare conditions within our players only.

1. Two phones (the owner's idea). Plassmann et al. 2008; Shiv et al. 2005; Nisbett & Wilson 1977 (part 3). / A
   price cue on an object worth nothing to anyone; whether stated reasons name the price (ours). / Thousands of
   choices, the grab itself, head-direction dwell on each phone before choosing. / Part 3d.
2. Choice blindness with the hand. Johansson et al. 2005; Hall et al. 2010, 2012 (objekt-papers). / VR versions:
   one screen study (38 people) and one poster (3b); trick-aware players are the authors' own failure case. / Choice
   by grasp, detection measured at scale, prior knowledge logged. / Pick the nicer of two objects 10 times; 2 are
   swapped when pocketed; "why this one?"
3. Moral action vs judgment. Francis et al. 2016, PLoS ONE 11(10):e0164374 (objekt-papers/francis-2016.txt):
   "a greater endorsement of utilitarian responses ... when action was required" than in judgment. At home:
   Kissel et al. 2023, Societies 13:69 (33 valid; 5 said their logged action was accidental; 06-science.md). /
   Does the gap hold in thousands, across cultures? (ours) / Hesitation time, aborted hand movements. / Judge a
   (non-gory) dilemma in words, then meet it with a lever; ask "was that what you meant?"
4. Proteus effect (avatar height and bargaining). Huber & Gajos 2020 (1b): online replication with d 0.34 vs
   1.23, only 27 headset users; the original, Yee & Bailenson 2007 (Human Communication Research 33:271-290), not
   read (search listing: taller avatars "behaved more confidently in a negotiation task": unverified). / Its size
   with a tracked first-person body (ours). / Real embodiment, many players. / Random avatar height seen in a
   mirror, then split 100 points with an agent.
5. Doorway effect. McFadyen et al. (2021), "Doorways do not always cause forgetting: a multimodal investigation",
   BMC Psychology 9:41, https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40359-021-00536-3 (read in the browser, earlier
   pass; open copy https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7938580): "we observed no significant effect of doorways
   on forgetting", except under working-memory load in VR. Sample sizes per experiment: not re-read in this pass
   (unverified). / Whether the effect exists; the paper asks "what factors contributed to the effect observed in
   previous studies". / Our building is a corridor of doors; huge N settles a small effect. / Carry an object
   through a door vs the same distance in one room; a memory probe halfway.
6. Cheating with a virtual observer. Mol, van der Heijden & Potters (2020), Experimental Economics,
   https://doi.org/10.1007/s10683-020-09644-0 (READ, objekt-papers/mol-2020.txt): 118 analysed, 30 rounds of a
   slot-machine "mind game", one round paid in euros; "60% (71/118)" cheated beyond chance; cheating rate Passive
   0.74 > No avatar 0.71 > Active 0.66; only Passive vs Active differed (p = 0.029): "not less cheating than in a
   control condition without an avatar". / Whether it holds with points instead of money (ours). / Lying is seen
   only in the distribution, never per person: no one is accused. / A private pick, then report it for points;
   observer watching, looking at a phone, or absent.
7. Navigation with the body. Spiers et al. 2023 (1b): 3.9 million players, male advantage in all 63 countries. /
   Whether phone-game scores hold when the body turns in VR (ours). / Head and body turns logged. / Study a map,
   then reach three targets in a building.
8. Social influence in an emergency. Kinateder & Warren 2016, doi:10.3389/frobt.2016.00043 (06-science.md): 68%
   of VR participants thought the alarm was staged; responses smaller than real. / Plausibility when players
   expect tricks. / Weak fit: startle at home (Steed et al.).
9. Conformity to virtual agents. Kyrlitsias & Michael-Grigoriou 2018; Kyrlitsias et al. 2020,
   doi:10.3389/fpsyg.2020.02254 (06-science.md): unambiguous task 1.14% wrong; ambiguous 5-s task 63% conformed
   at least once. / What makes agents count as a group. / Ambiguous judgment after agents answer aloud.
10. Obedience (Slater et al. 2006; Gonzalez-Franco et al. 2018, 06-science.md): obedience higher in VR. Not
   recommended for home play: distress without a supervisor.
