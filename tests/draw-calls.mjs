// How many draw calls one frame of a place costs in VR, at its worst view, counted on the real XR path:
// the smoke test puts on Meta's emulated headset (IWER, tests/smoke-vr.mjs) with both eyes drawn, as a
// headset draws them (no multiview in A-Frame 1.7.1: src/rooms/01-control/scene.js). Quest 2, the
// weakest headset whose budget the game keeps (docs/owner-decisions.md), wants fewer than 100 a frame
// (Meta, device optimization comparison: docs/research/vr/01-meta.md).
// Neither place is under it yet. The controllers' models alone draw 28 a frame (six parts and a ray
// each, both eyes: A-Frame's laser-controls), and about half of the room's worst view is the corridor
// behind its shut door, drawn although the walls hide it (docs/board.md). FRAME_BUDGET holds each
// place near its measure so it cannot grow unseen while that work goes on; each comes down with it.
// A budget kept only in memory grew unseen, so the smoke test measures it on every push.
// Runs in the page (the smoke test passes it to page.evaluate): self-contained, it uses only the
// page's THREE, document and the emulated headset (window.__xr). eyes: boxes [[x0, y0, z0], [x1, y1,
// z1]] where an eye can be; the views stand at their middle and at the middle of each half along the
// longer side, at standing eye height (1.6 m, or the box's top), looking every 45 degrees round,
// level. The worst view's calls are counted by the nearest entity with an id that holds each drawn
// mesh (by): where the next cut is (Meta's order: measure first, then merge:
// docs/research/revision-4-graphics.md).
